# Linear Congruential Number Generator

Linear Congruential Number Generators (LCG)s are a type of psuedu-random number generator and usually have teh form of:

$$x_n=(ax_{n-1}+c)mod(m)$$

where 

* $0\leq a \leq m$: is the multiplier

* $0\leq c \leq m$: is the incerement

* $0 \leq m$: is the modulos
